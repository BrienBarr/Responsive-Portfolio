                    <p>
                        My name is Brien Barr.  I was born in Danville, IN, and I have lived in Indiana my whole life.
                        I studied at Ball State University in Muncie, IN.  After four years studying there, I obtained a 
                        Bachealor of Arts degree, majoring in Telecommunications with a Audio/Video Production concentration 
                        with a minor in Film Studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from Ball State, I attended the Recording Workshop in Chillicothe, OH.  There, I obtained 
                        certificates in Audio Engineering, Studio Maintenance, Advanced Audio Engineering, and Emerging Audio Technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon leaving the Recording Workshop, I was able to find a job at the company where I am currently employed.  
                        My first duties included assisting in audio and video editing, maintaining and updating the company website, and 
                        maintaining the in-house data servers, workstations, and network.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        After 18 years, I am still with the same company.  In addition to maintaining and updating the company website, in-house 
                        data servers, workstations, and network, I am the content production manager, a project manager, a project estimator, and 
                        a systems programmer.  I also create the company's marketing materials for web and print.  Among these positions, I have
                        also been a project coordinator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been happily married for three years.  My wife and I just had identical twin girls in March of 2020.  When I am
                        not working or in school, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughters.  I am also a big fan of football, baseball, 
                        and basketball, rooting for the Indianapolis Colts, Cincinnati Reds, and the Indiana Pacers.  I also enjoy reading and collecting 
                        comics and reading Star Wars and James Bond novels.  I am also a huge fan of movies.
